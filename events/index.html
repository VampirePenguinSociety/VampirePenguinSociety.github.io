                    <h1>About Events</h1>
                    <h2>Events Overview</h2>
                    <p>The VPS Mini-Events are short, chill hangouts where we do stuff like hunt dragons, stop geysers, and fight our way through harrowstorms. Generally hosted by Royal Vampguins, anyone in the guild can host one with a Royal Vampguin's approval. Anyone of any level can join, provided you have access to the zone the event is occurring in. Being in the Discord voicechat for the event is highly recommended.</p>
                    <p>Sign up for the event, show up in time for grouping, and have fun! </p>
                    <h2>Event Rules</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Come to groupings prepared.</strong><br>
                            When the grouping for an event starts, you're expected to be ready to head out soon as everyone arrives -- including a semi-cleared inventory and all skills/gears equipped. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Do not aggro before host.</strong><br>
                            It's not fun to arrive to a world boss or dragon fight and see it killed right before you could get there. Don't be the reason that happens by aggroing a boss early. The event host will make the call of when to aggro a fight (or, if a random person aggros, whether to help or not). 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Don't hold back the group.</strong><br>
                            If the event is one that involves a lot of travel, try to keep up with the group or teleport to a group member once they're at the nearest wayshrine to the destination. If you need to take a longer pause, such as to go to the loo or make a snack irl, consider asking the group whether they want to start on the next part without you and you'll hop back in when you can.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
