                    <h1>About Trials</h1>
                    <h2>Trials Overview</h2>
                    <p>Arguably the biggest PVE events that the guild hosts are trials. These 12-person events will each be hosted by a Vampguin Raidmaster and require a lot of planning in advance, so signups will be highly enforced.</p>
                    <p>We know that life happens, but <strong>try to give the trial host a 24-hour warning in advance if you plan to withdraw.</strong> Presence in discord voicechat is required for trials unless noted otherwise (you can have your mic off, just make sure you're there to hear instructions).</p>
                    <p>All trials signups currently occur in the guild discord, in the <strong>#trials</strong> channel.</p>
                    <h2>Trials Rules</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Come to trial groupings prepared.</strong><br>
                                When the grouping for a trial starts (usually 15 minutes before the start time of a trial), you're expected to be ready for the trial -- to have skillpoints allocated, inventory cleared out, gear and skills properly slotted.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Do not interrupt the person explaining mechanics.</strong><br>
                                When someone is explaining mechanics, this probably means that someone in the group is not too familiar with the trial and wants the mechanics to be reviewed. Do not interrupt. (If you have questions for mechanics, try to save them to the end of the explanation.) 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Do not aggro the boss unless the group is ready; do not aggro the boss until the tank is ready.</strong><br>
                                We've all accidentally aggro'ed a boss once or twice, but please try to avoid during so when others (especially the tank) aren't ready (or during explanations of mechanics).
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Keep comms clear during battles.</strong><br>
                                Busy comms can cause important stuff to be missed or not heard. Try to keep unneeded chatter to a minimum during fights, especially during tougher boss fights. This is also good practice for those who plan to try vet trials in the future.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Make sure you're not appearing anonymously in encounter logs.</strong><br>
                                Encounter logs are how we keep track of who participates in trials and how they do. These logs are used to help the guild understand where we can improve and what we're doing well; however, it can be difficult for a lot of people (especially for supports) to read a log with multiple "anonymous" entries. To change this setting in game, go to Settings > Combat > turn off "Appear Anonymously" in the Encounter Log section.
                            </p>
                        </li>
