                    <h1>About Trials</h1>
                    <h2>Trials Overview</h2>
                    <p>Arguably the biggest PVE events that the guild hosts are trials. These 12-person events will each be hosted by a Vampguin Raidmaster and require a lot of planning in advance, so signups will be highly enforced.</p>
                    <p>All trials signups currently occur in the guild discord, in the <strong>#trials</strong> channel.</p>
                    <h2>Trials Rules</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Come to trial groupings prepared.</strong><br>
                                When the grouping for a trial starts (usually 15 minutes before the start time of a trial), you're expected to be ready for the trial -- to have skillpoints allocated, inventory cleared out, gear and skills properly slotted.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Do not interrupt the person explaining mechanics.</strong><br>
                                When someone is explaining mechanics, this probably means that someone in the group is not too familiar with the trial and wants the mechanics to be reviewed. Do not interrupt. (If you have questions for mechanics, try to save them to the end of the explanation.) 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Do not aggro the boss unless the group is ready; do not aggro the boss until the tank is ready.</strong><br>
                                We've all accidentally aggro'ed a boss once or twice, but please try to avoid during so when others (especially the tank) aren't ready (or during explanations of mechanics).
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Keep comms clear during battles.</strong><br>
                                Busy comms can cause important stuff to be missed or not heard. Try to keep unneeded chatter to a minimum during fights, especially during tougher boss fights. This is also good practice for those who plan to try vet trials in the future.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Presence in voicechat during trials is required unless noted otherwise.</strong><br>
                                Trials often require a lot more group coordination than dungeons. It is important for everyone to be present in voicechat during trials so that everyone is on the same page. You don't need to have your mic on; what's most important is that you're there to hear instructions and callouts. (However, if you are playing a support role like a tank or healer, a mic is HIGHLY recommended.) 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>If you must cancel your signup, do so at least 24 hours in advance.</strong><br>
                                We know life happens; however, trials take A LOT of effort to schedule, and losing signups last-minute risks the trial being cancelled for everyone. If you do need to cancel a signup within 24 hours of the trial start time, you'd better have a really good reason.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Make sure you're not appearing anonymously in encounter logs.</strong><br>
                                Encounter logs are how we keep track of who participates in trials and how they do. These logs are used to help the guild understand where we can improve and what we're doing well; however, it can be difficult for a lot of people (especially for supports) to read a log with multiple "anonymous" entries. To change this setting in game, go to Settings > Combat > turn off "Appear Anonymously" in the Encounter Log section.
                            </p>
