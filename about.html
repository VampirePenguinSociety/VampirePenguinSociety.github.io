                    <h1>About the Guild</h1>
                    <h2></h2>
                    <p>The <strong>Vampire Penguin Society</strong> is an ESO guild on the PC-NA Megaserver, with a strong focus on PvE content and with a casual playstyle.</p>
                    <p>Though we are smaller than other guilds in number, we are an active guild, hosting multiple events each week and welcoming new members with open arms.</p>
                    <p>The guild was started quite a while ago, in Fall of 2020, by a group of friends who had started playing ESO during the pandemic. Originally, the goal was a small private guild, just to get a guild bank to store stuff in.</p>
                    <p>Fast forward a few weeks or months. During this time, one of the original VPS members had becomea de-facto leader of trials in a trading guild (Klub Kerfuffle). Eventually, the trials activity grew, and it was decided that the trials branch should split off into its own guild. And thus, attention came to the small private guild and repurposing it into a larger, public, and more active group. Along with this came the setup of a discord server, etc, and then recruitment (mostly from the allied trading guild).</p>
                    <p>And so, we now have the Vampire Penguin Society.</p>
                    <p>We've been going strong ever since, and we don't plan on stopping anytime soon -- if anything, we've also started to expand a bit to other games as well.</p>
                    <p>If you're looking to joing our ranks, then search for us in-game using the Guild Finder or send a dm/mail to <strong>@Space-Keet</strong>. We look forward to gaming with you!</p>
                    <p>And if you're already a member, then we're glad to have you! Let us know if you have any questions, and be sure to join our Discord (link is in the Guild>About page in-game in ESO), where we interact the most and host trial and event signups, etc.</p>
